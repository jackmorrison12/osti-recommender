# Osti: Recommender

This is the server which hosts the music recommendation engine and playlist generation of [Osti](https://osti.uk)

It runs on a [Heroku machine](https://osti-recommender.herokuapp.com)

To run this locally, you'll need to install the requirements in `requirements.txt`, and set up a Python virtual environment (there are loads of tutorials of how to do this online)

Then it can be run using the command `gunicorn app:app`
